In this work, we present the latest improvements to the library, including efforts to simplify the attribution of large language models on consumer hardware, additional attribution approaches, and a new client command to detect and attribute context usage in language model generations. We showcase an online demo using Inseq as an attribution backbone for context reliance analysis, and we highlight interesting contextual patterns in language model generations. Ultimately, this release furthers Inseq’s mission of centralizing good interpretability practices and enabling fair and reproducible model evaluations.},

However, the evaluation of these techniques has so far been limited to single conditioning properties and synthetic settings. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various activation steering strategies, highlighting the property-dependent nature of optimal parameters to ensure a robust effect throughout generation. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Activation Composition, an information-theoretic approach to modulate the steering intensity of one or more properties throughout generation. Our experiments on multi-property steering show that our method successfully maintains high conditioning while minimizing the impact of conditioning on generation fluency.",

					that can be used to study Ancient Greek semantics: a count-based model, a word embedding model and a syntactic embedding model;

title = "Viability of Automatic Lexical Semantic Change Detection on a Diachronic Corpus of Literary Ancient Greek",
abstract = "We apply two measures of lexical semantic change detection to Word2Vec embeddings trained on a diachronic corpus of literary Ancient Greek texts. The two measures are the Vector Coherence, based on the comparison between vectors of the same word in different time periods, and the J, based on the Jaccard coefficient, which quantifies the overlap between the k nearest neighbours in each possible combination of time slices. Through the analysis of the most stable and unstable words detected with both measures, we show that the two measures are effective at finding non-changed words, while Vector Coherence seems to be more reliable than J at detecting changed words. Still, low J could indicate a real semantic change when the same word also has a low Vector Coherence. For both measures, the detection of changed words is hampered by the presence of lemmatization errors in the training corpus.",

As most research mainly focuses on English, with few explorations in a multilingual context, the question of how reliable this reasoning capability is in different languages is still open. To address it directly, we study multilingual reasoning consistency across multiple languages, using popular open-source LLMs. First, we compile the first large-scale multilingual math reasoning dataset, *mCoT-MATH*, covering eleven diverse languages. Then, we introduce multilingual CoT instruction tuning to boost reasoning capability across languages, thereby improving model consistency. While existing LLMs show substantial variation across the languages we consider, and especially low performance for lesser resourced languages, our 7B parameter model *mCoT* achieves impressive consistency across languages, and superior or comparable performance to close- and open-source models even of much larger sizes.",

Still, while there has been emphasis on data quantity, less attention has been given to its quality. In this work, we investigate the impact of human intervention on machine-generated data when fine-tuning dialogical models. In particular, we study (1) whether post-edited dialogues exhibit higher perceived quality compared to the originals that were automatically generated; (2) whether fine-tuning with post-edited dialogues results in noticeable differences in the generated outputs; and (3) whether post-edited dialogues influence the outcomes when considering the parameter size of the LMs. To this end we created HED-IT, a large-scale dataset where machine-generated dialogues are paired with the version post-edited by humans. Using both the edited and unedited portions of HED-IT, we fine-tuned three different sizes of an LM. Results from both human and automatic evaluation show that the different quality of training data is clearly perceived and it has an impact also on the models trained on such data. Additionally, our findings indicate that larger models are less sensitive to data quality, whereas this has a crucial impact on smaller models. These results enhance our comprehension of the impact of human intervention on training data in the development of high-quality LMs.",

To facilitate such studies, we present a method for annotating metonymies in domain- and genre-independent text. We advocate an annotation scheme that builds on regularities in metonymic usage, that takes underspecification in metonymic reference into account, and that is organized hierarchically. We combine previous metonymy classification proposals with insights from a corpus study to present a fullyworked-out annotation scheme for location names, illustrating the previously mentioned principles.We present several experiments measuring annotation agreement and show that the annotation scheme is reliable and has wide coverage. We also provide a gold standard for annotations of this kind consisting of 2,000 annotated occurrences of country names in the British National Corpus.We use the resulting corpus to study metonymy distributions and the factors that influence the choice of literal versus metonymic readings in real texts. }

As a contribution, we describe a general framework for annotating metonymies in domain- independent text that considers the regularity, productivity and underspecification of metonymic usage. We will then concentrate on two fully worked out annotation schemes for location and organisation names and rigorously evaluate these schemes as to their reliability. We also present a gold standard corpus consisting of 4000 annotated occurrences of location and organisation names in the British National Corpus. We use this corpus to examine the distribution of metonymies as well as for experiments in automatic metonymy resolution.},

abstract="We approach cross-lingual question answering by using a mono-lingual QA system for the source language and by translating resulting answers into the target language. As far as we are aware, this is the first cross-lingual QA system in the history of CLEF that uses this method---almost without exception, cross-lingual QA systems use translation of the question or query terms instead. We demonstrate the feasibility of our alternative approach by using a mono-lingual QA system for English, and translating answers and finding appropriate documents in Italian and Dutch. For factoid and definition questions, we achieve overall accuracy scores ranging from 13{\%} (EN{\textrightarrow}NL) to 17{\%} (EN{\textrightarrow}IT) and lenient accuracy figures from 19{\%} (EN{\textrightarrow}NL) to 25{\%} (EN{\textrightarrow}IT). The advantage of this strategy to cross-lingual QA is that translation of answers is easier than translating questions---the disadvantage is that answers might be missing from the source corpus and additional effort is required for finding supporting documents of the target language.",

We present three lexical resources for Italian MWEs, namely an electronic lexicon, a series of example corpora and a database of MWEs represented around morphosyntactic patterns. These resources are matched against, and created from, a very large web-derived corpus for Italian that spans across registers and domains. We can thus test expressions coded by lexicographers in a dictionary, thereby discarding unattested expressions, revisiting lexicographers's choices on the basis of frequency information, and at the same time creating an example sub-corpus for each entry. We organise MWEs on the basis of the morphosyntactic information obtained from the data in an electronic, flexible knowledge-base containing structured annotation exploitable for multiple purposes. We also suggest further work directions towards characterising MWEs by analysing the data organised in our database through lexico-semantic information available in WordNet or MultiWordNet-like resources, also in the perspective of expanding their set through the extraction of other similar compact expressions.",

We show that the schemes we developed are reliable, and that the actual distribution of partitive and non-partitive uses of Â“neÂ” is inversely proportional to the amount of attention that the two different uses have received in the linguistic literature. As an assessment of the complexity of the resolution task, we find that a recency-based baseline yields an accuracy of less than 30{\%} on both development and test data.",

We investigate the effect of automatic normalization on POS tagging of tweets. We also compare normalization to strategies that leverage large amounts of unlabeled data kept in its raw form. Our results show that normalization helps, but does not add consistently beyond just word embedding layer initialization. The latter approach yields a tagging model that is competitive with a Twitter state-of-the-art tagger.",

Cross-lingual embeddings circumvent some of these limitations, but capture gender-specific style less. We propose an alternative: bleaching text, i.e., transforming lexical strings into more abstract features. This study provides evidence that such features allow for better transfer across languages. Moreover, we present a first study on the ability of humans to perform cross-lingual gender prediction. We find that human predictive power proves similar to that of our bleached models, and both perform better than lexical models.",

This enables automatic interpretation of idiomatic expressions, which is important for applications like machine translation and sentiment analysis. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for English that makes use of literalisations of idiom senses to improve disambiguation, which is based on the lexical cohesion graph-based method by Sporleder and Li (2009). Experimental results show that, while literalisation carries novel information, its performance falls short of that of state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",

Concurrently, they have also been used to expose how strongly human biases are encoded in vector spaces trained on natural language, with examples like man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker. Recent work has shown that analogies are in fact not an accurate diagnostic for bias, but this does not mean that they are not used anymore, or that their legacy is fading. Instead of focusing on the intrinsic problems of the analogy task as a bias detection tool, we discuss a series of issues involving implementation as well as subjective choices that might have yielded a distorted picture of bias in word embeddings. We stand by the truth that human biases are present in word embeddings, and, of course, the need to address them. But analogies are not an accurate tool to do so, and the way they have been most often used has exacerbated some possibly non-existing biases and perhaps hidden others. Because they are still widely popular, and some of them have become classics within and outside the NLP community, we deem it important to provide a series of clarifications that should put well-known, and potentially new analogies, into the right perspective.",

In addition, through a deeper analysis of part-of-speech tagging, we show that also within a given task, information is spread over different parts of the network and the pipeline might not be as neat as it seems.

  abstract={In the last few years, pre-trained neural architectures have provided impressive improvements across several NLP tasks. Still, generative language models are available mainly
for English. We develop GePpeTto, the first
generative language model for Italian, built
using the GPT-2 architecture. We provide
a thorough analysis of GePpeTto’s quality
by means of both an automatic and a humanbased evaluation. The automatic assessment
consists in (i) calculating perplexity across different genres and (ii) a profiling analysis over
GePpeTto’s writing characteristics. We find
that GePpeTto’s production is a sort of bonsai version of human production, with shorter
but yet complex sentences. Human evaluation
is performed over a sentence completion task,
where GePpeTto’s output is judged as natural more often than not, and much closer to
the original human texts than to a simpler language model which we take as baseline.},

It is not only that manual annotation is expensive, it is also the case that the phenomenon is sparse, causing human annotators having to go through a large number of irrelevant examples in order to obtain some significant data. Strategies used until now to increase density of abusive language and obtain more meaningful data overall, include data filtering on the basis of pre-selected keywords and hate-rich sources of data. We suggest a recipe that at the same time can provide meaningful data with possibly higher density of abusive language and also reduce top-down biases imposed by corpus creators in the selection of the data to annotate. More specifically, we exploit the controversy channel on Reddit to obtain keywords that are used to filter a Twitter dataset. While the method needs further validation and refinement, our preliminary experiments show a higher density of abusive tweets in the filtered vs unfiltered dataset, and a more meaningful topic distribution after filtering.",

Since a variety of biases have previously been found in standard word embeddings, it is crucial to assess biases encoded in their replacements as well. Focusing on BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), we measure gender bias by studying associations between gender-denoting target words and names of professions in English and German, comparing the findings with real-world workforce statistics. We mitigate bias by fine-tuning BERT on the GAP corpus (Webster et al., 2018), after applying Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS) (Maudslay et al., 2019). We show that our method of measuring bias is appropriate for languages such as English, but not for languages with a rich morphology and gender-marking, such as German. Our results highlight the importance of investigating bias and mitigation techniques cross-linguistically,especially in view of the current emphasis on large-scale, multilingual language models.",

We propose a method that may overcome these problems by adapting existing pre-trained models to new languages. Specifically, we describe the adaptation of English GPT-2 to Italian and Dutch by retraining lexical embeddings without tuning the Transformer layers. As a result, we obtain lexical embeddings for Italian and Dutch that are aligned with the original English lexical embeddings. Additionally, we scale up complexity by transforming relearned lexical embeddings of GPT-2 small to the GPT-2 medium embedding space. This method minimises the amount of training and prevents losing information during adaptation that was learned by GPT-2. English GPT-2 models with relearned lexical embeddings can generate realistic sentences in Italian and Dutch. Though on average these sentences are still identifiable as artificial by humans, they are assessed on par with sentences generated by a GPT-2 model fully trained from scratch.}

To raise awareness, curiosity, and longer-term interest in young people, we have developed an interactive workshop designed to illustrate the basic principles of NLP and computational linguistics to high school Italian students aged between 13 and 18 years. The workshop takes the form of a game in which participants play the role of machines needing to solve some of the most common problems a computer faces in understanding language: from voice recognition to Markov chains to syntactic parsing. Participants are guided through the workshop with the help of instructors, who present the activities and explain core concepts from computational linguistics.

By combining the new lexical layers and fine-tuned Transformer layers, we achieve high task performance for both target languages. With high language similarity, 10MB of data appears sufficient to achieve substantial monolingual transfer performance. Monolingual BERT-based models generally achieve higher downstream task performance after retraining the lexical layer than multilingual BERT, even when the target language is included in the multilingual model.}

We propose a novel approach to this task that leverages generic resources, and without using any task-specific parallel (source{--}target) data outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on the two most popular style transfer tasks: formality transfer and polarity swap. In practice, we adopt a multi-step procedure which builds on a generic pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model (BART). First, we strengthen the model{'}s ability to rewrite by further pre-training BART on both an existing collection of generic paraphrases, as well as on synthetic pairs created using a general-purpose lexical resource. Second, through an iterative back-translation approach, we train two models, each in a transfer direction, so that they can provide each other with synthetically generated pairs, dynamically in the training process. Lastly, we let our best resulting model generate static synthetic pairs to be used in a supervised training regime. Besides methodology and state-of-the-art results, a core contribution of this work is a reflection on the nature of the two tasks we address, and how their differences are highlighted by their response to our approach.",

Accurate NNC interpretation, i.e. determining the implicit relationship between the constituents of a NNC, is crucial for the advancement of many natural language processing tasks. Until now, computational NNC interpretation has been limited to approaches involving linguistic representations only. However, much research suggests that grounding linguistic representations in vision or other modalities can increase performance on this and other tasks. Our work is a novel comparison of linguistic and visuo-linguistic representations for the task of NNC interpretation. We frame NNC interpretation as a relation classification task, evaluating on a large, relationally-annotated NNC dataset. We combine distributional word vectors with image vectors to investigate how visual information can help improve NNC interpretation systems. We find that adding visual vectors increases classification performance on our dataset in many cases.",

We then train regression models that predict the salience of GBV participants with respect to different dimensions of perceived responsibility. Our best model (fine-tuned BERT) shows solid overall performance, with large differences between dimensions and participants: salient {\_}focus{\_} is more predictable than salient {\_}blame{\_}, and perpetrators{'} salience is more predictable than victims{'} salience. Experiments with ridge regression models using different representations show that features based on linguistic theory similarly to word-based features.

We further unpack this finding in two directions by zooming in on a single language, namely Persian. First, still focusing on POS tagging we run an in-depth analysis of the behaviour of Persian with respect to closely related languages and languages that appear to benefit from cross-lingual transfer with Persian. To do so, we also use the World Atlas of Language Structures to determine which properties are shared between Persian and other languages included in the experiments. Based on our results, Persian seems to be a reasonable potential language for Kurmanji and Tagalog low-resource languages for other tasks as well. Second, we test whether previous findings also hold on a task other than POS tagging to pull apart the benefit of language similarity and the specific task for which such benefit has been shown to hold. We gather sentiment analysis datasets for 31 target languages and through a series of cross-lingual experiments analyse which languages most benefit from Persian as the source. The set of languages that benefit from Persian had very little overlap across the two tasks, suggesting a strong task-dependent component in the usefulness of language similarity in cross-lingual transfer.",

To address this expertise gap, we present a “Text Style Transfer” system.

However, the questions of when and which parts of the context affect model generations are typically tackled separately, and current plausibility evaluations are practically limited to a handful of artificial benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Plausibility Evaluation of Context Reliance (PECoRe), an end-to-end interpretability framework designed to quantify context usage in language models’ generations. Our approach leverages model internals to (i) contrastively identify context-sensitive target tokens in generated texts and (ii) link them to contextual cues justifying their prediction. We use PECoRe to quantify the plausibility of context-aware machine translation models, comparing model rationales with human annotations across several discourse-level phenomena. Finally, we apply our method to unannotated generations to identify context-mediated predictions and highlight instances of (im)plausible context usage in model translations.}

While the pre-trained models seem to be essentially the same, also by means of established similarity assessment techniques, the measurable tiny changes appear to substantially impact the models’ tuning path, leading to significantly different fine-tuned systems and affecting downstream performance. After testing a very large number of combinations, which we briefly summarize, the experiments reported in this short paper focus on an intermediate phase consisting of a single-step and single-sentence masked language modeling stage and its impact on a sentiment analysis task. We discuss a series of unexpected findings which leave some open questions over the nature and stability of further pre-training.}

Through a comparison of 14 pre-trained language models (mono- and multi-lingual, of varying sizes), we assess the internal consistency of the benchmark tasks, as well as the factors that likely enable high performance. Our results indicate that current Dutch monolingual models under-perform and suggest training larger Dutch models with other architectures and pre-training objectives. At present, the highest performance is achieved by DeBERTaV3 (large), XLM-R (large) and mDeBERTaV3 (base). In addition to highlighting best strategies for training larger Dutch models, DUMB will foster further research on Dutch. A public leaderboard is available at https://dumbench.nl.",

However, the strength of these determinants and underlying theories are rarely evaluated on their predictive ability on new data. This prevents us from systematically comparing studies, hindering the evaluation and accumulation of knowledge. In this paper, we present two datasets which can be used to study the predictability of fertility outcomes in the Netherlands. One dataset is based on the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey which includes thousands of variables on a wide range of topics, including individual preferences and values. The other is based on the Dutch register data which lacks attitudinal data but includes detailed information about the life courses of millions of Dutch residents. We provide information about the datasets and the samples, and describe the fertility outcome of interest. We also introduce the fertility prediction data challenge PreFer which is based on these datasets and will start in Spring 2024. We outline the ways in which measuring the predictability of fertility outcomes using these datasets and combining their strengths in the data challenge can advance our understanding of fertility behaviour and computational social science. We further provide details for participants on how to take part in the data challenge.},

But how are news media approaching climate change across countries? With the problem of climate change and its solution being global, it is key to determine whether differences in climate change news reports exist and what they are across countries. This study employs supervised machine learning to uncover topical and terminological differences between newspaper articles on climate change. An original dataset of climate change articles is presented, originating from 7 newspapers and 3 countries across the world, and published in English during 26 Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Three aspects are used to discriminate between articles, being (1) countries, (2) political orientations, and (3) COP meetings. Our results reveal differences with regard to how newspaper articles approach climate change globally. Specifically, climate change-related terminology of left-oriented newspapers is more prevalent compared to their right-oriented counterparts. Also, over the years, newspapers’ climate change-related terminology has evolved to convey a greater sense of urgency.}

  abstract={Figurative language generation (FLG) is the task of reformulating a given text to include a desired figure of speech, such as a hyperbole, a simile, and several others, while still being faithful to the original context. This is a fundamental, yet challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has recently received increased attention due to the promising performance brought by pre-trained language models. Our survey provides a systematic overview of the development of FLG, mostly in English, starting with the description of some common figures of speech, their corresponding generation tasks and datasets. We then focus on various modelling approaches and assessment strategies, leading us to discussing some challenges in this field, and suggesting some potential directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that summarizes the progress of FLG including the most recent development in NLP. We also organize corresponding resources, e.g., paper lists and datasets, and make them accessible in an open repository. We hope this survey can help researchers in NLP and related fields to easily track the academic frontier, providing them with a landscape and a roadmap of this area.}
