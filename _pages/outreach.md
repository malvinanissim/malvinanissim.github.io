In May 2017 I gave a TEDx Talk titled "Serendipity Beyond Stereotypes", 
where I talk about one of my research topics, namely _Author Profiling_, 
especially in terms of gender, and argue that humans and machines are complementary in finding indicative clues. 
I also argue that machines can surprise us, and make us think in a way that is less bound to stereotypes hardwired in our brains.

I was asked to tell in less than 2 minutes how we train machines to tell whether two texts are written by the same person or not. This is a field called "Authorship Attribution", and there was recently an article on The Economist about this. And more info about the video is [here](https://www.rug.nl/about-us/news-and-events/news/archief2017/nieuwsberichten/0301-unifocusnissim).

On September 22nd 2017 I gave a plenary talk at the PhD Day on how to conduct PhD research in a not-too-narrow way. I enjoyed it very much, especially interacting with the 900+ audience of PhD students via throw-microphones! (In the video you can see me throw one.)
