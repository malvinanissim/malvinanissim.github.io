In May 2017 I gave a TEDx Talk titled "Serendipity Beyond Stereotypes", 
where I talk about one of my research topics, namely _Author Profiling_, 
especially in terms of gender, and argue that humans and machines are complementary in finding indicative clues. 
I also argue that machines can surprise us, and make us think in a way that is less bound to stereotypes hardwired in our brains. 

* Mini-Lecture, Lecturer of the Year 2016

Here is where I explain, in 9 minutes, the field of _Author Analysis_ This mini-lecture was given in the Aula of the Academy Building in the context of the 2016 Lecturer of the Year election at the University of Groningen. More info [here](https://www.rug.nl/about-us/news-and-events/events/lecturer-of-the-year/2016/dr-m.-nissim---faculty-of-arts).


* Unifocus video, 'Who Wrote the Text?'
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWii8QD92A8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"> </iframe>
I was asked to tell in less than 2 minutes how we train machines to tell whether two texts are written by the same person or not. This is a field called "Authorship Attribution", and there was recently an article on The Economist about this. And more info about the video is [here](https://www.rug.nl/about-us/news-and-events/news/archief2017/nieuwsberichten/0301-unifocusnissim).

* PhD Day 2017 (aftermovie)

On September 22nd 2017 I gave a plenary talk at the PhD Day on how to conduct PhD research in a not-too-narrow way. I enjoyed it very much, especially interacting with the 900+ audience of PhD students via throw-microphones! (In the video you can see me throw one.) 

## Science Festivals and Schools

Under the auspices of [AILC](https://www.ai-lc.it), the Italian Association for Computational Linguistics, I have coordinated some dissemination activities which we have brought to Science Festivals and schools in Italy, and for which we have created shareable materials. The main person behind this effort is [Ludovica Pannitto](https://www.ellepannitto.it/), in collaboration with [Lucia Busso](https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/persons/lucia-busso), [Roberta Combei](https://twitter.com/robertacombei), [Mirko Lai](http://www.di.unito.it/~lai/), Lucio Messina, [Alessio Miaschi](http://pages.di.unipi.it/miaschi/), [Gabriele Sarti](https://gsarti.com/). New activities and new materials upcoming! Most of the past ones are listed below (in chronological order).

### Activities
