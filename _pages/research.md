My research interests are in the broad field of Computational Linguistics, Language Technology, and Digital Humanities, with a lot of attention to the societal relevance of language-based AI technology and developments, obviously including LLMs and conversational agents.

There are frequently situations where I have to summarise in just one line what I'm interested in research-wise. Observing what I've resorted to say during the years, paired with what I do in practice, I'd say now that what I'm most interested in is *how people write*. My research topics are more nuanced than that, and not all focus on that, but the red thread, and my possibly even subconscious drive, eventually is indeed that.

**NOTE** (June 2025) A lot of different smaller and bigger projects are going on at the moment, so I'm taking some time to completely renew and reorganise this page - please be patient and stay tuned, content coming soon!
