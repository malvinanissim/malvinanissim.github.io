I work in Natural Language Processing and its application to societally relevant problems. Besides my research activities I am particularly active in science communication and outreach, including to school children, especially towards an aware and responsible use of language technologies. I really enjoy public speaking, and once I got to give a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcyTQK-FaMM). I was also invited by the European Council to give a plenary lecture on gender bias in Artificial Intelligence on International Women's Day 2021. As a university professor I teach quite a bit, and I love it - proud to be elected as the 2016 University of Groningen [Lecturer of the Year](https://www.rug.nl/news/2017/01/dr.-malvina-nissim-elected-lecturer-of-the-year).
