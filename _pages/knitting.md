I'm a keen knitter.

Sometimes I go a few weeks or even months without knitting, all busy with work, and with no exception, every time I pick it up again I wonder how I have survived without. I have a huge stash of which I'm both proud and embarrassed.

I have a [Ravelry profile](https://www.ravelry.com/people/lamalvi) with sparse accounting of the projects I start and sometimes finish, and very many wishes and favourite knits and patterns.

Whenever I travel I tend to visit yarn shops, mostly abroad since I love to see what they are like in countries I do not know well. Still, I regularly visit my local spots, too. My go-to shop in Groningen is [Achterpand](https://www.achterpand.nl/home/), on the beautiful Lage der A.
