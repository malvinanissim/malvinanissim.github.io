## Awards and Recognition
I was awarded a [Fellowship for Innovation of Teaching](https://www.rug.nl/about-us/where-do-we-stand/quality-works/fellowships-innovation-teaching/) to develop [a podcast course](/podcast/) in 2018.

In 2016 I was elected as the [Lecturer of the Year of the Faculty of Arts](https://www.rug.nl/let/organization/actueel/nieuwsberichten-2016/2016-12-01-nissim-docent-van-het-jaar?lang=en), and shortly after as the Lecturer of the Year as the whole University of Groningen. 
This is the sample lecture I gave to a general audience in the context of that competition:
