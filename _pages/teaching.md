Since 2022 we have included a course called Ethical Aspects in NLP in our Bachelor in Information Science. As a final project, my students go to high schools to talk about the perks and perils of language technology.

## Programmes I teach in

I teach several courses at the University of Groningen.
- [Bachelor of Science in Information Science](https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/information-science/?lang=en)
- [Master of Science in Information Science](https://www.rug.nl/masters/information-science/?lang=en)
- [Research Master in Linguistics](https://www.rug.nl/masters/linguistics-research/?lang=en)
- [Master of Arts in Digital Humanities](https://www.rug.nl/masters/digital-humanities/)
- [University Minor Data Wise](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/education/minor/datawise?lang=en) 

Aside supervising master theses, I also regularly supervise groups of master students on small projects, and we often participate in international shared tasks. In some cases we did really well (like in the *Author Profiling* task at [PAN 2016](https://pan.webis.de/clef16/pan16-web/author-profiling.html#award) and [PAN 2017](https://pan.webis.de/clef17/pan17-web/author-profiling.html#award))

## Awards and Recognition

I was awarded a [Fellowship for Innovation of Teaching](https://www.rug.nl/about-us/where-do-we-stand/quality-works/fellowships-innovation-teaching/) to develop [a podcast course](/podcast/) in 2018.

In 2016 I was elected as the [Lecturer of the Year of the Faculty of Arts](https://www.rug.nl/let/organization/actueel/nieuwsberichten-2016/2016-12-01-nissim-docent-van-het-jaar?lang=en), and shortly after as the Lecturer of the Year as the whole University of Groningen. 
This is the sample lecture I gave to a general audience in the context of that competition:
