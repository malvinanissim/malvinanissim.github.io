I teach several courses within the bachelor and master programmes in Information Science at the University of Groningen.
<br><br>
Aside supervising master theses, I also regularly supervise groups of master students on small projects, and we often participate in international shared tasks.
<br><br>
In 2016 I was elected as the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/let/organization/actueel/nieuwsberichten-2016/2016-12-01-nissim-docent-van-het-jaar?lang=en">Lecturer of the Year of the Faculty of Arts</a>, and shortly after as the Lecturer of the Year as the whole University of Groningen. 
This is the sample lecture I gave to a general audience in the context of that competition:
