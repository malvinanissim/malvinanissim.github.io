<h3 id="tedx">TEDx Talk on Humans, AI, and Stereotypes</h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NcyTQK-FaMM" width="280" height="157" frameborder="0"> </iframe>
<br>
In May 2017 I gave a TEDx Talk titled "Serendipity Beyond Stereotypes", 
where I talk about one of my research topics, namely <i>Author Profiling</i>, 
especially in terms of gender, and argue that humans and machines are complementary in finding indicative clues. 
I also argue that machines can surprise us, and make us think in a way that is less bound to stereotypes hardwired 
in our brains.

<h3 id="unifocus">Unifocus video, 'Who Wrote the Text?'</h3>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWii8QD92A8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"> </iframe>
  <br>
  I was asked to tell in less than 2 minutes how we train machines to tell whether two texts are written by the same person or not. This is a field called "Authorship Attribution", and there was recently an article on The Economist about this. And more info about the video is <a href="https://www.rug.nl/about-us/news-and-events/news/archief2017/nieuwsberichten/0301-unifocusnissim?lang=en"">here</a>.

  <br>
On September 22nd 2017 I gave a plenary talk at PhD Day 2017 on how to conduct PhD research in a not-too-narrow way. I enjoyed it very much, especially interacting with the 900+ audience of PhD students via throw-microphones! (In the video you can see me throw one.)
