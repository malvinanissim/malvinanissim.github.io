TEDx Talk on Humans, AI, and Stereotypes.
<br>
In May 2017 I gave a TEDx Talk titled "Serendipity Beyond Stereotypes", where I talk about one of my research topics, namely <i>Author Profiling</i>, especially in terms of gender, and argue that humans and machines are complementary in finding indicative clues. I also argue that machines can surprise us, and make us think in a way that is less bound to stereotypes hardwired in our brains. The full video is on YouTube, you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcyTQK-FaMM">here</a>

  Unifocus video, "Who Wrote the Text?"
  <br>
  I was asked to tell in less than 2 minutes how we train machines to tell whether two texts are written by the same person or not. This is a field called "Authorship Attribution", and there was recently an article on The Economist about this.

  Aftermovie of the PhD Day 2017, Groningen
  <br>
On September 22nd 2017 I gave a plenary talk at PhD Day 2017 on how to conduct PhD research in a not-too-narrow way. I enjoyed it very much, especially interacting with the 900+ audience of PhD students via throw-microphones! (In the video you can see me throw one.)
