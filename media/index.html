TEDx Talk on Humans, AI, and Stereotypes.

<ul>
  <li>In May 2017, I gave a TEDx Talk titled "Serendipity Beyond Stereotypes", where I talk about one of my research topics, namely <i>Author Profiling</i>, especially in terms of gender, and argue that humans and machines are complementary in finding indicative clues. I also argue that machines can surprise us, and make us think in a way that is less bound to stereotypes hardwired in our brains. The full video is on YouTube, you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcyTQK-FaMM">here</a>
  <li>I was asked to tell in less than 2 minutes how we train machines to tell whether two texts are written by the same person or not.
